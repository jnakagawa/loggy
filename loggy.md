2. Ask for my GitHub repository URL (with validation)
3. Ask for my BigQuery dataset path (with validation)
4. Ask for output directory 
   - Ask for these one by one rather than all at once so it's easy for user to parse
   - **Security: Validate all user inputs**:
     - GitHub URLs must match: `https://github.com/[owner]/[repo]`
     - BigQuery paths must match: `project.dataset.table`
     - Output directories must be valid and safe paths 

5. Check the following prerequisites and install for the user if they are not present (using sandboxed, user-space installations):
   - **Node.js** (via NVM - no sudo required):
     ```bash
     # Install NVM if not present
     curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
     source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
     nvm install --lts
     nvm use --lts
     ```
   - **GitHub CLI** (via Homebrew if available, otherwise download binary):
     ```bash
     # If Homebrew is available:
     brew install gh
     # Otherwise, download binary to user directory:
     curl -sSL https://github.com/cli/cli/releases/latest/download/gh_*_linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar -xz -C ~/bin
     ```
   - **Google Cloud SDK** (user installation):
     ```bash
     # Download and install to user directory (no sudo)
     curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
     source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
     ```
   - **Repomix** (on-demand execution):
     ```bash
     # Use npx to run without installing (recommended)
     npx repomix
     ```
   - **No additional dependencies needed** - using Claude's native file processing


6. Additional setup for Google Cloud SDK:
   ```bash
   # SDK tools should be automatically added to PATH by the installer
   # If needed, manually add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
   source ~/google-cloud-sdk/path.bash.inc
   source ~/google-cloud-sdk/completion.bash.inc
   
   # Verify installation
   gcloud --version
   bq --version
   ```

7. Additional dependencies (most systems have these, but verify):
   ```bash
   # Python (usually pre-installed, verify with):
   python3 --version
   
   # Git (usually pre-installed, verify with):
   git --version
   
   # If missing, install via user-space package managers like NVM/conda/etc.
   ```

8. Authenticate BigQuery CLI and GitHub (with secure token handling)
   - **Security: Create secure config directory**:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p ~/.config/loggy && chmod 700 ~/.config/loggy
     ```
   - BigQuery authentication:
     ```bash
     gcloud auth application-default login
     ```
   - GitHub authentication (using personal access token):
     ```bash
     # Ask user to create a GitHub personal access token with 'repo' scope
     # Guide: https://github.com/settings/tokens
     echo "🔐 For security, your token input will be hidden"
     gh auth login --with-token
     # User will paste their token when prompted
     ```
   - **Security: Clear shell history of sensitive commands**:
     ```bash
     history -d $(history | tail -n 5 | head -n 1 | awk '{print $1}') 2>/dev/null || true
     ```
   - Test BigQuery CLI by listing the 10 tables in the dataset

9. Test GitHub by cloning the user-provided repo URL to the working directory (keep it there)

10. Run repomix inside the cloned repo - make note of the repomix-output.xml file

10.1. Create intelligent code index for fast searching:
    - Use grep to create a searchable index of event-related code
    - Build index once: `grep -n -E "(event|Event|analytics|track)" repomix-output.xml > event-index.txt`
    - This creates a small index file with line numbers for instant lookups
    - **Always search the event-index.txt first** before reading the full repomix-output.xml

11. Ask for documentation template markdown file (use default documentation format shown below if left blank)

12. Show analysis progress with ASCII progress bars

13. Ask user if they want to generate all events in one batch or validate one by one
    - If user wants to loop through events: go through tables in dataset one by one, use this workflow:
      1. **First**: Search event-index.txt for the specific event name (e.g., "ext_feedback")
      2. **Then**: Use the line numbers from the index to read relevant sections from repomix-output.xml
      3. **Finally**: Extract event definitions, triggers, and field descriptions from those sections
    - For each event/table:
      - Check event-index.txt for matches: `grep "event_name" event-index.txt`
      - Read specific line ranges from repomix-output.xml based on index results
      - Generate documentation using the extracted code context
    - IF user approves, then write a markdown file to the output directory 
    - Ask if user wants to writeback the generated table descriptions and schema field definitions
      - if yes - then use BQ cli to writeback the table description and schema field defintions in the bigquery source table


## Technical Implementation Strategy:
- **Always**: Search event-index.txt FIRST before accessing repomix-output.xml - this is the key to fast performance
- **Never**: Read the full repomix-output.xml without first checking the index for relevant line numbers
- **Always**: Maintain the beautiful ASCII interface throughout
- **Authentication**: Help user with authentication steps and setting up proper projects when needed. If authentication commands are required - run them for the user, don't ask them to run the command. If the user needs permissions or API activations, guide them towards what permissions they need to ask for.
- **Security**: Implement input validation and secure practices:
  - Validate GitHub URLs: `^https://github\.com/[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+/[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+/?$`
  - Validate BigQuery paths: `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$`
  - Create secure config directory with 700 permissions
  - Clear sensitive commands from shell history
- **Index-First Workflow**: 
  1. Check event-index.txt for patterns
  2. Extract line numbers from index results
  3. Start by reading those specific line ranges from repomix-output.xml 
  4. Generate documentation from the targeted code sections

## User Experience Goals:
- Keep technical barriers as low as possible
- Explain any required setup steps clearly
- Focus on transforming scattered tracking code into organized, actionable documentation
- Maintain conversational, helpful tone throughout

# Default Documentation Format
If user doesn't provide their own documentation format - use this as default (ext_health_check.md example):


# [event_spec] ext_health_check

# Description

Monitors the health and performance of the extension's storage systems to ensure proper functionality and prevent quota-related issues. This event collects diagnostic information about local storage, session storage, and overall browser storage usage to identify potential problems before they affect user experience.

The health check performs write tests to verify storage accessibility and collects usage metrics across different storage types to track capacity utilization and prevent storage quota exceeded errors.

## Affected Surface

Adblock, Shopping, Unified, Mobile, or Web
